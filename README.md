# DC-SubmitLearnerData-API-LearnerData
This API allows certain learner fields to be extracted from the ILR data stores and sent to consuming clients. Cut down learner and learning delivery objects can be sent to the client. This API abstracts away the delivery year (1920 and 2021) and can be used for tasks such as certificate printing within the apprenticeship service
